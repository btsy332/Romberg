# Romberg
This is a simple C++ program written for a Numerical Methods in Physics course. It implements Romberg integration to numerically evaluate a definite integral.

## What it does:

Computes the integral of a function using Romberg’s method

Uses trapezoidal rule refinement and Richardson extrapolation

Example implemented: sin(x)

Stops when the desired tolerance is reached
